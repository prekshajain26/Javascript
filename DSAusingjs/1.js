console.log("1"+1) /* it will give 11 because when we giving one string value and adding it with a
number so our addition sign will convert into concatenation sign and will give 11 because + sign
has two meanings in coding */

console.log("1"-1) /* it will give 0 only because minus has only one meaning that is to substract 
so if we are giving one string value it will convert that string into number and then do substraction */

console.log("1"*1) 
console.log("1"/1)
// same concept of minus will be applied to multiplication and division
