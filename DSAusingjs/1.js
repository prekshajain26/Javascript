// ****************    TYPE COERCION   ***********************
// console.log("1"+1)
 /* it will give 11 because when we giving one string value and adding it with a
number so our addition sign will convert into concatenation sign and will give 11 because + sign
has two meanings in coding */

// console.log("1"-1)
 /* it will give 0 only because minus has only one meaning that is to substract 
so if we are giving one string value it will convert that string into number and then do substraction */

// console.log("1"*1) 
// console.log("1"/1)
// same concept of minus will be applied to multiplication and division
 

//accept and print the number -- prompt()
//prompt is a function and it returns output as a string 
// let age=prompt("enter your age");
// console.log(age)
// so to convert into number let age=Number(prompt("enter your age")); 

// ********************** SWAPPING USING 3 METHODS *********************

// 1st Method - using third variable
/* let a=10;
let b=20;
let temp;
console.log(`Before swapping value of a is ${a} and b is ${b}`)
temp=a;
a=b;
b=temp;
console.log(`After swapping value of a is ${a} and b is ${b}`) */

// 2nd Method -- without taking extra variable
/*
