//      JAVASCRIPT EXECUTION CONTEXT -- means how the js will do the execution of your js files

/* to run the files js divides it into two phases
now when we give file to js for execution  compulsorily it creates GLOBAL EXECUTION CONTEXT and 
it is put inside a variable which is called THIS 
SO,
1) is GLOBAL EXECUTION CONTEXT
2) is FUNCTION/FUNCTIONAL EXECUTION CONTEXT

Phases in which the file is executed are -
1) MEMORY CREATION PHASE (OR CREATION PHASE) - only it allocates space to variables 
2) 21EXECUTION PHASE -in this phase execution is done
